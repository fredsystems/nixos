# Agent Guide -- NixOS Flake Repository

This document is the always-on orientation for AI coding agents and human
contributors working in this NixOS flake. **Operational procedures are no
longer inlined here** -- they live as opencode skills under
`.opencode/skills/` and are loaded on demand. This document gives you the
map; the skills give you the moves.

---

## Repository overview

This is a NixOS flake managing **9 Linux hosts** (7 servers + 2 desktops)
and at least one macOS (nix-darwin) host. The infrastructure is heavily
aviation / SDR-focused -- most servers run containerised ADS-B, VDL-M,
and HFDL decoders.

### Host classification

| Host      | Type    | Notes                                     |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Daytona   | Desktop | NixOS-unstable + home-manager (unstable)  |
| maranello | Desktop | NixOS-unstable + home-manager (unstable)  |
| fredhub   | Server  | Stable channel but pulls one unstable pkg |
| fredvps   | Server  | VPS, custom SSH port, extra user (nik)    |
| acarshub  | Server  | ADS-B decoder hub                         |
| vdlmhub   | Server  | VDL Mode 2 decoder hub                    |
| sdrhub    | Server  | SDR receiver hub                          |
| hfdlhub1  | Server  | HFDL decoder                              |
| hfdlhub2  | Server  | HFDL decoder                              |

Desktops are hardcoded in `ci-linux.yaml` as
`desktop_names=("Daytona" "maranello")`. Everything else from
`nixosConfigurations` is treated as a server.

Servers default to the **stable** channel (`nixpkgs-stable`,
`home-manager-stable`, `catppuccin-stable`, `sops-nix-stable`).
Per-server overrides are possible via the node table in
`flake/hosts/servers.nix`.

`fredhub` is a stable-channel server that imports one package from
unstable `nixpkgs`. CI treats changes to the `nixpkgs` input as
"desktops + fredhub".

## Skills you will need in this repo

These are loaded on demand by opencode when their description matches
the task. The full bodies live under `.opencode/skills/`.

| Skill                       | When it fires                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `nixos-eval-impacted-hosts` | Before pushing any change. Computes impacted hosts from the diff and runs evals.           |
| `nixos-input-category-sync` | When editing flake inputs / `flake.lock` / `ci-linux.yaml` / the impacted-hosts script.    |
| `nixos-add-host`            | When adding a new host (server or desktop).                                                |
| `nixos-add-flake-input`     | When adding (or removing) a flake input.                                                   |
| `precommit-fix-loop`        | When a commit is rejected by pre-commit hooks.                                             |
| `commit-discipline`         | Before any commit / PR.                                                                    |
| `testing-mandate`           | Before declaring any task done.                                                            |
| `no-summary-documents`      | Before creating any new markdown file.                                                     |
| `markdown-lint-discipline`  | Before writing or editing any `.md` file. MD031, MD040, table widths, no emojis in tables. |

If the skill doesn't fire automatically and you think it should, that
means the skill description needs a stronger trigger -- fix the skill,
don't paste its contents into this file.

## CI in one paragraph

`ci-linux.yaml` has a `find-systems` job that classifies changed paths
(via a bash `case` statement) and parses `flake.lock` diffs (input-aware)
to decide which hosts to rebuild. `dorny/paths-filter` was rejected
because negation patterns under picomatch match nearly every file. The
matrix builds toplevel + home-manager activation for each impacted host
and pushes to the Attic binary cache at `192.168.31.14`. Any
`evaluation warning:` in stderr fails the build. `build-linux-summary`
is the required status check.

The full input-to-category mapping (the source of truth shared between
`flake.nix` comments, this file, `ci-linux.yaml`, and the impacted-hosts
script) is in the `nixos-input-category-sync` skill. When changing it,
load that skill.

## Update workflows

- **`update-flakes.yaml`** runs weekly, opens one PR per input via
  `fredsystems/flake-update-action` with automerge.
- **Renovate Bot** runs weekly; lock file maintenance opens a single PR
  with all `flake.lock` changes; also manages Docker image tags and
  GitHub Actions pins; everything automerges via `platformAutomerge`.

---

## Maintenance rules (one-liners; full procedures in skills)

- **Adding a new host** -> `nixos-add-host` skill.
- **Adding / removing / recategorizing a flake input** ->
  `nixos-add-flake-input` skill, which references
  `nixos-input-category-sync`.
- **Verifying a change before push** -> `nixos-eval-impacted-hosts`
  skill (includes a bundled script that mirrors the CI's filter
  exactly).
- **Modifying CI filtering logic in `ci-linux.yaml`** -> remember the
  `case` order rule (specific patterns before broad ones) and the
  four-place sync invariant; load `nixos-input-category-sync`.

---

## What this file deliberately does NOT contain

The following used to live here. They were moved to skills to keep this
file as a stable orientation document and to avoid paying the token cost
on every turn:

- The full input-to-category mapping table -> `nixos-input-category-sync`.
- The step-by-step procedures for adding hosts and inputs -> their
  respective skills above.
- The detailed CI job graph and filtering outcome table -> implementation
  detail; trust the workflow itself and the impacted-hosts script.
- The "three places to keep in sync" warning -> elevated to four places
  (the impacted-hosts script is a fourth) in
  `nixos-input-category-sync`.

If you're tempted to add a long procedure back to this file, write it as
a skill instead.
